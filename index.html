                <div class="paragraph">
                    <h2>Mingalarbar</h2>
                    <p>"Mingalarbar" (pronounces min-ga-lar-bar). Its meaning is depend on the situation. If you say Mingalarbar
                        when you meet someone, it mean "Hello" or "May you be blessed". Sometimes, it means "Bye". 
                        Remind that you don't need to stress to say burmese words. My language isn't much difficult but 
                        complicated, if you add even only one letter, whole meaning can change. So be careful. In English, 
                        the pattern is 
                        Subject + Verb + Object, but in Burmese, Subject + Object + Verb. To understand the meaning, 
                        you need to listen whole speech haha that's bad.
                        Burmese language has 33 letters and all of them are curved. Like English, Myanmar has many synonym words. 
                        Although they have same meaning, there are specific place to use each one.
                    </p>
                    <img class="images" src="Language images/A-set-of-Myanmar-alphabet.png">
                    <p> You can also learn from Youtube or google translator. I admit that I sometimes use English-Myanmar google 
                        translator but I don't recommend to use the translator. Because if you add only one word or even a letter
                        to the sentence the whole meaning can change. You can rely on the youtube videos but some phrases that use in 
                        videos are barely use between Native Speakers. They are more use in writing. I will give you an example, hope you understand.
                        ( I wrote the example in PDF file and screenshot it, because sometimes browser can't read Myanmar Font instead the words will appear
                        as boxes.)

                    <h2>Vowels</h2>
                    <img class="images" src="Language images/vowels.gif">
                    <p>These are vowels. ( (letters)Ka Gyi to Ah are consonants ) In Burmese most words don't have their 
                        own meanings. They need vowels to have the meanings.</p>
                        <p>I tried to make a explanation about vowels but it is hard for you to understand, So I choose the 
                            video from Youtube, this video will explain you vividly about the vowels. If you don't understand just let me know. Okay?

                        It pronounces ca-GYI, "Ca" is nearly same pronounciation with "Ca" from "car".
